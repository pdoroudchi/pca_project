# Welcome to my *Principal Component Analysis at a Glance* Repo!

I created this repo to share a final paper I drafted for an undergraduate linear algebra course during Summer 2020. In this paper I:

- Researched theory and applications of principal component analysis (PCA) in PDF report created with R Markdown and LaTeX
- Walked through optimization solution and matrix theory behind how the robust dimension-reduction method works
- Applied PCA to NBA and decathlon data in R, discussing model selection rules and demonstrating visualization tools
